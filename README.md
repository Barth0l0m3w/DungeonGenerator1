## DungeonGenerator

# Itteration1:
In this unity project, you will find a dungeon generator made with prefab rooms (as many as needed). The size of the grid/amaunt of rooms can be altered in the inspector and will be saved in the folder from the hierarchy of your selection. this way you will be able to save, make, and compare as many as you wish.

# Itteration2:
After taking a look at this project 2 years later, i quickly spotted mayor points for improvement. 
So i have spent some time to implement: 
- better tooling
- code conventions
- project structure
- inspector setup and buttons
- self-modeled and textured assets

The generator now only has a single button to generate a new dungeon and to delete it. 
Navmesh now also gets deleted through the inspector buttons, instead of just in code.
